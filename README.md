# Profile Card App

## Project Description

This **Profile Card App** is a simple and responsive web application built using **React.js** and **CSS** for displaying user profile cards. Each card contains basic information about a user such as their name, bio, email, age, and phone number. The app is designed to adapt to various screen sizes using **CSS Grid** and **Media Queries**, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes **CSS Grid** and **Media Queries** for a responsive layout that adjusts based on the screen size. The profile cards are displayed in multiple columns on larger screens and a single column on smaller screens (e.g., mobile).
- **User Profile Display**: Each profile card contains a user's photo, name, bio, and contact details. Icons are used for email, age, and phone number, which are revealed when clicked by the user.
- **Mobile-first Approach**: Optimized for mobile devices first, ensuring that users can easily view and interact with the app on phones and tablets.
- **React Integration**: The app is built using **React.js**, leveraging the component-based architecture for easy reusability and maintainability.
